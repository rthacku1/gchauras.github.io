I work at [McGill University] teaching privileged Gen X students.
I teach French language, culture and literature, and incorporate the latest pedgagogy into my classroom.
I completed my MSc under the guidance of [Michael Zuniga] at [University of Quebec a Montreal] in the beautiful city of
Montreal. I also obtained a Masters degree in Anglophone literature at [Universite Paris VII]. In an
earlier life, I used to be an undergrad there, and have spent significant time at [Middlebury College] in Vermont, USA.
