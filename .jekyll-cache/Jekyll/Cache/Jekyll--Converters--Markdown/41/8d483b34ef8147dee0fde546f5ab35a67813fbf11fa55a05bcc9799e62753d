I"¿<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>Since moving to Zurich, I have picked up hiking as a favourite sport. I have started maintaining a list of <a href="hiking.html">hikes</a> since 2016.</p>

<p>I occassionally go biking for 800 m climbs around Zurich. It used to me primary sport during PhD. I like uphill (800 - 1000 m) or long distance (~100 km) biking on my mountain bike. I tried some long bike rides outside Boston and it was fun. The French Riviera is a dream spot for biking. My dream is to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Bonette">La Bonnet</a> someday.</p>

<p>I like bouldering at <a href="http://minimum.ch/">Minimum boulders</a>. I climbed at <a href="http://brooklynboulders.com/somerville/">Brooklyn Boulders</a> and <a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~mitoc/wall/">MIT climbing gym</a> while I was in Boston. I compiled a list of <a href="climbing.html">climbing gyms</a> in the Boston metropolitan area. Bouldering is a social sport and I am always happy to go with people.</p>

<p>My best run was 14 km in 1:04:00 in a bygone era of youth when I was on the happier side of 25. My sensitive left knee does not let me run as often as I should, plus its hard :(  I cannot run or bike on a treadmill. There is something about outdoors that keeps me going. I can swim a little â€“ 2km breaststroke in a 1 hour session but my front-crawl is terrible.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>I like reading for leisure. I currently have enough books to keep me occupied for the next 7-8 months. After that I will try to buy <a href="books.html">these books</a>.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>I am trying to teach myself some piano. I do not have time to take organised lessons, so I am sticking to online tutorials and self practice. Hopefully, some day I will be able to play some real music.</p>

<h2 id="past-hobbies">Past Hobbies</h2>

<p>In days of distant past, I continued an ancestral tradition of philately. I still have the complete collection.</p>
